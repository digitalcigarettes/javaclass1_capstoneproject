Before you run the casino:

1. Make sure to go into the file to change the path for the images into your own user
	C:/User/[YOURUSENAME]/ <-[YOUR DIRECTORY] \{NAME OF ZIP/FOLDER}\lobby\imgs\cards\JPEG
	ex: C:\Users\Edward\Documents\Downloads\capstoneproject\lobby\imgs\cards\JPEG
	^ go to line 84 to the loadPath() method, or use CTRL/CMD F to find it

IF THE BLACKJACK GAME DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY, IT IS BECAUSE THE PICTURE FILE PATH IS WRONG.

2. In every source file with an error at the top on the line declaring a package (ex. package lobby.yahtzee;),
click on the error in eclipse and click "Move '[file].java' to package 'lobby.[file]' " (ex. Move 'Yahtzee.java' to package 'lobby.yahtzee')

3. Run the Casino and happy gambling!
